## Senior Data Analyst, Media & Analytics task

Criteo advertises to billions of people across the world each month. This provides the Analytics team with mountains of data to analyze, which we use to inform our internal strategy and make
recommendations to our clients. 

Imagine it is January 1st, 2025, and you are presented with the attached data. Can you help put together a PowerPoint presentation and answer the questions below?

**Questions:**
1. We are trying to assess how much the Brazil (BR) market is exposed to its top clients. How many
clients are needed to make up 40% of Brazilâ€™s clicks in 2024? 
2. Which device presents the biggest opportunity for [CLASSIFIED COMPANY]  globally and why?
3. What is the impact of the holiday sales period on the fashion industry? How does user behavior
change during this time? (Pick a country of your choice)
4. How much client revenue will we generate for our US advertisers in Q1 2025? Present your
methodology.
5. What would your advice to the [CLASSIFIED COMPANY] leadership be for 2025?

Feel free to use whatever tools you would like to perform your analysis and to be creative in your analysis and recommendations. We will ask you to present your findings to a panel of fellow analyst and/or commercial stakeholder where the team will dig into your approach, ask follow-up questions, and look for your insight on the data. Do not hesitate to reach out with clarifying questions!

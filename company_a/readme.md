## Senior Data Analyst task, classified company

The key aspect of ride-hailing is upfront pricing, which works in the following way:

- Firstly, it predicts the price for a ride based on the predicted distance and time. This price is what you see on the screen of the phone before ordering a ride.
- Secondly, if the metered price (based on actual distance and time) differs a lot from the predicted one, the upfront price switches to the metered price. 
	- 'A lot' implies more than 20%. For example, suppose you want to take a ride for which the upfront price is predicted as 5 euros. If the metered price is between 4 and 6 euros - the rider pays 5 euros, otherwise the metered price.

**Task:** We would like to improve the upfront pricing precision. Please analyse the data and identify top opportunities for that. Could you suggest a course of action?

**Bonus:** Is there any other value you can extract from this data? (Feel free to get creative!)

**Submission:** Assume that both business and technical people will check the results.

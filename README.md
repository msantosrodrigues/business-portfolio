# So you got here...

While most people tend to create websites for a portfolio, I am on my budget right now.

In the moment I am writing this description, I may be in one of the most sensitive moments of my life, in many aspects.

But it isn't an ask for mercy or pity: you will be there too, like me, one day. 
If you won't, you are living here, in the rock bottom, and that's even worse.

I bring it because I think it's very important to take lessons from this kind of moment because, usually, we pass on them alone: ashamed, silent, and apart from people we love but don't have the courage to count on.
I am silent too, apart and trying not to be ashamed anymore because the man that got me here, from where I came, couldn't be ashamed or have the luxury of weakness. 

That's how I know this moment is something I am going through but isn't me.
